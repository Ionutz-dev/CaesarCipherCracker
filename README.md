# CaesarCipherCracker

Welcome to CaesarCipherCracker, a user-friendly console application designed to crack the Caesar cipher. This C++ project utilizes classical cryptography methods to decipher texts encrypted with the Caesar cipher, offering an educational tool for understanding one of the oldest encryption techniques.

## Features

- **Multiple Decryption**: Decrypt multiple messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher in a single session.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Utilizes frequency analysis to guess the shift used in the Caesar cipher.
- **User-Friendly Console Interface**: Easy-to-navigate console interface for inputting multiple encrypted messages and viewing their decrypted output.
- **Custom Shift Decryption**: Allows users to decrypt messages by specifying their own shift value for each text.
